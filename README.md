## Project Description

In Flataculties, users can view a list of animal names and their corresponding images. They can click on an animal's name to see its details, including the image and the number of votes received. Users also have the ability to add votes for each animal, which will be displayed alongside the animal's details.

The project uses a local API server to fetch and update data. The server is set up using the `json-server` package and a `db.json` file that stores the animal data.
